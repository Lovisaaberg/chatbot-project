# chatbot-project

This interactive bot is built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, focusing on DOM manipulation, functions and scope.

### The Problem

Creating a good flow for the bot's questions was a bit challenging. To address this, I approached the task step by step and added detailed comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each function. I also thought it was important for the user to be able to exit at any time.
